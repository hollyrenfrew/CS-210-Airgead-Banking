\# Enhancement Plan – Algorithms \& Data Structures



\## Planned Enhancements



1\. Replace annual-only compounding with monthly compounding

2\. Store yearly results in a vector of custom structs

3\. Use STL sorting and searching algorithms

4\. Introduce stack and queue structures for transaction history

5\. Improve numeric precision and validation

6\. Refactor formatting and computation logic for separation of concerns



\## Expected Outcome



These enhancements improve accuracy, scalability, and maintainability while demonstrating mastery of algorithmic design and data structure usage aligned with CS‑499 outcomes.
